# Intelligent_Robotics
The task was to design and write a Ros Node that allows the robot to autonomously explore the lower ground floor (lgf) map provided, without getting stuck and avoid collision with sensed obstacles.  This project builds upon the socs pioneer project found at:  https://github.com/justagist/socspioneer
